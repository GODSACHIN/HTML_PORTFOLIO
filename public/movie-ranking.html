<h1>The Best Animes According to Sachin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>It is an amzing anime based on an orphan child who wants to become the hokage of his village.
To achive this he struggles and persevere a lot. 
At the end he is able to accomplish his dream.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
<p>It was joyous ride, full of emotion, while watching this anime.
The main character of this anime is "Goku" or often known by his Sayain name "Kakarot".
He is just like an angle to all the anime fans.
He is said to be the inspiration of many big animes such as Naruto, Bleach and One Piece.
</p>
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>This is one of the best animes of all time.
It is about a child who wants to be the 'King of the pirates'.
To be the King of Pirates doesn't mean that he wants to hurt people or even loot them.
He just wants to have the maximum freedom possible.Freedom to just as he please (without being controlled by the World Govt.).
